## Introduction

Social media platforms like Twitter, Telegram, and WhatsApp become critical communication channels during natural disasters. Affected people post urgent appeals for rescue, food, medical aid, and shelter. However, the massive volume of messages — most of which are non-urgent or informational — overwhelms emergency response organizations.

Simple keyword-based filtering fails because semantic intent, not the presence of specific words, determines urgency. Additionally, disaster-related messages in India are frequently written in regional languages not adequately supported by existing systems.

This project builds a multilingual classification system that categorizes disaster-related social media messages into five actionable classes:

| Class | Description |
|---|---|
| **Critical Rescue** | People displaced, injured, dead, or missing — immediate response needed |
| **Resource Requests** | Requests for food, water, shelter, medical supplies, or other aid |
| **Volunteering and Donations** | Offers of help, donation drives, volunteer coordination |
| **Situational Awareness** | Infrastructure damage, weather updates, caution advisories, general info |
| **Irrelevant** | Sympathy messages, unrelated content, unclear/unjudgeable posts |

## Dataset

We use the [HumAID](https://crisisnlp.qcri.org/humaid_dataset.html) dataset — a collection of ~77K manually annotated disaster-related tweets from 17 major natural disaster events (2016–2019), including earthquakes, hurricanes, wildfires, and floods.

Additionally, a small manually annotated dataset of disaster messages in an Indian regional language is used for cross-lingual evaluation.

### Label Mapping

HumAID's 11 original humanitarian labels are mapped to our 5 target classes:

| HumAID Label | → Target Class |
|---|---|
| `displaced_people_and_evacuations`, `injured_or_dead_people`, `missing_or_found_people` | Critical Rescue |
| `requests_or_urgent_needs` | Resource Requests |
| `rescue_volunteering_or_donation_effort` | Volunteering and Donations |
| `caution_and_advice`, `infrastructure_and_utility_damage`, `other_relevant_information` | Situational Awareness |
| `sympathy_and_support`, `not_humanitarian`, `dont_know_cant_judge` | Irrelevant |

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9 or higher
- pip (Python package manager)
- Git
- (Optional) NVIDIA GPU with CUDA for transformer fine-tuning

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/disaster-response-classification.git
cd disaster-response-classification
```

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended)

**Windows:**
```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```

**Linux / macOS:**
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

For transformer notebooks (XLM-RoBERTa), install PyTorch separately based on your system:
- **With GPU (CUDA):** Visit [https://pytorch.org](https://pytorch.org) and select your CUDA version
- **CPU only:** `pip install torch torchvision`

### 4. Download the HumAID Dataset

1. Go to [https://crisisnlp.qcri.org/humaid_dataset.html](https://crisisnlp.qcri.org/humaid_dataset.html)
2. Download both event sets:
   - `HumAID_data_events_set1_47K` (11 events)
   - `HumAID_data_events_set2_29K` (6 events)
3. Extract and place them in the `data/raw/` directory:

```
data/raw/
├── events_set1/
│   ├── canada_wildfires_2016/
│   │   ├── canada_wildfires_2016_train.tsv
│   │   ├── canada_wildfires_2016_dev.tsv
│   │   └── canada_wildfires_2016_test.tsv
│   ├── cyclone_idai_2019/
│   │   └── ...
│   └── ... (11 events)
└── events_set2/
    ├── california_wildfires_2018/
    │   └── ...
    └── ... (6 events)
```

### 5. Update the Base Path

Open `notebooks/Data_Preprocessing.ipynb` and update `BASE_DIR` in the configuration cell to point to your project directory:

```python
BASE_DIR = r"C:\path\to\your\disaster-response-classification"
```

Update the same `BASE_DIR` in all other notebooks as well.

### 6. Run the Notebooks

Run the notebooks **in order**. Each notebook depends on the output of the previous one.

| Order | Notebook | Description | GPU Required |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `Data_Preprocessing.ipynb` | Loads raw data, maps labels, preprocesses text, generates EDA plots, saves `humaid_processed.csv` | No |
| 2 | `Baseline_SVM.ipynb` | TF-IDF + LinearSVC baseline | No |
| 3 | `Baseline_Naive_Bayes.ipynb` | TF-IDF + Multinomial Naive Bayes baseline | No |
| 4 | `Baseline_Logistic_Regression.ipynb` | TF-IDF + Logistic Regression baseline | No |
| 5 | `XLM_RoBERTa.ipynb` | Fine-tuning multilingual transformer | Yes (recommended) |
| 6 | `Cross_Lingual_Evaluation.ipynb` | Zero-shot evaluation on Indian language data | Yes (recommended) |
| 7 | `Error_Analysis.ipynb` | Comparative error analysis across all models | No |

**Note:** Notebooks 2–4 (baselines) can be run in any order after notebook 1. Notebook 5 must be run before notebook 6. Notebook 7 should be run last after all models have been trained.

## Reproducing Results

To reproduce all results reported in the project report:

```bash
# 1. Set up environment
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/disaster-response-classification.git
cd disaster-response-classification
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate          # Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 2. Download HumAID data into data/raw/ (see step 4 above)

# 3. Update BASE_DIR in all notebooks

# 4. Run notebooks in order (1 → 7)
#    Open each notebook in Jupyter and run all cells
jupyter notebook notebooks/
```

If you only want to reproduce the baseline results (no GPU needed), run notebooks 1–4 and skip 5–6.

## Dependencies

```
pandas>=1.5.0
numpy>=1.23.0
matplotlib>=3.6.0
seaborn>=0.12.0
scikit-learn>=1.2.0
nltk>=3.8.0
transformers>=4.30.0       # For XLM-RoBERTa notebook
torch>=2.0.0               # For XLM-RoBERTa notebook
```

See `requirements.txt` for the complete list.

## Evaluation Metrics

Given the high-stakes nature of disaster response, we prioritize **recall** for urgent categories (Critical Rescue and Resource Requests). A missed urgent message can result in delayed assistance and serious harm.

Metrics reported:
- Precision, Recall, and F1-score per class
- Macro and Weighted F1-score
- Confusion matrix analysis
- Dangerous false negative rate (urgent messages classified as non-urgent)

## Known Issues

- **Class imbalance:** Resource Requests is the smallest class (~3.4% of data). All models use balanced class weights to mitigate this.
- **HumAID tweet text:** Some tweets may have been deleted from Twitter since the dataset was created. The dataset provides the tweet text directly, so this does not affect our experiments.
- **GPU memory:** If XLM-RoBERTa runs out of GPU memory, reduce `batch_size` from 16 to 8 in the notebook configuration.
